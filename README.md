# Overview of the analysis:
Dana's webpage and dynamic table are working as intended, but she'd like to provide a more in-depth analysis of UFO sightings by allowing users to filter for multiple criteria simultaneously. In addition to the date, you'll add table filters for the city, state, country, and shape.
We have developed a web page that uses an ufo_app.js file, and to pull data, we are using the ufo_data.js and display it in the index.html.
 The capability of the web page allow us to search UFO sightings of Are we alone in the universe? For millennia, humans have turned to the sky to answer this question. Now, thanks to research generously funded by W. Avy, a UFO-enthusiast and amateur ufologist, we can supplement our sky-searching with data analysis.

What You're Creating
This new assignment consists of one technical analysis deliverable and a written report. You will submit the following deliverables:

Deliverable 1: Filter UFO sightings on multiple criteria
Deliverable 2: A written report on the UFO analysis (README.md)

Deliverable 1 Instructions
Using JavaScript and HTML, you'll modify the code in your index.html file to create more table filters. In addition to the date filter you created in this module, you'll add filters for the city, state, country, and shape, as shown in the following image:

Using JavaScript, you'll replace the handleClick() function in your app.js file with a new function that saves the element, value, and id of the filter that was changed. Then, you'll create a new function to loop through the dataset and keep only the results that match the search criteria. The webpage will be updated with the search criteria after pressing "Enter".

The list element that creates the button is removed, and there are five list elements for filtering in the index.html file.
The event listener is modified to detect changes to each filter in the app.js file.
â€‹The updateFilters() function saves the element, value, and the id of the filter that was changed.
The filterTable() function loops through all of the filters and keeps any data that matches the filter values.
The webpage filters the table correctly based on user input.

# Results with detail analysis:
There is a description of how to perform a search with images.
UFO Sightings data can be filtered or search by entering any of the following options; Date, City, State, Country, or Shape. Below you can find a picture of the fields to find UFO Sighting.

# Summary:
The summary addresses one drawback of this webpage 
The summary addresses two additional recommendations for further development 
It feels great to have an understanding of how to develop websites. I have learned the essential components to build a clean and user-friendly website. Although it allows the user to filter through different sightings in the data set using search bars, one drawback of the search bar is to validate where UFO sighing happened. We can add a newsfeed bar with the most recent UFO sighting to guide the user to find the data. 
If we had how many people were at the siting would be a helpful element to validating the claims. Having as much data as possible for the website would make it as good as it can be. 
My two recommendations to improve the website would be to add data validation and pictures of the UFO sighting. I would add a user newsfeed for a user to interact with the page to add their comments and photos of their most recent encounter of UFO sighing. It will help validate and drive more traffic to the page.
